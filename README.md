# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Wilson! (like the volleyball)

### About Me:

-  Iâ€™m interested in solving puzzles with Excel/SQL/Python
-  I am a hands-on learner and I love to figure things out on my own (Thanks, Google!)
-  Iâ€™m currently learning how to build my intro page on Github. It'll get better, I promise!
-  In my free time, I like to get together with friends and play some :basketball:
